This is an API endpoint implementing javascript and the Node.JS framework. 
I have utilized the code of Yelp-Fusion-API in order to create calls to Oscars Pub N Grill in Milwaukee from my
API endpoint. All while trying to complete this within a 2-3 hour timeframe to simulate a potential work order,
I hope that this code is easy to follow and allows you to recreate with ease.
